I’m Ting Chung (鍾欣庭), a researcher and commentator focused on defense technology, institutional resilience, and economic strategy. I study how software-defined systems, industrial policy, and democratic governance interact—especially in Taiwan’s unique position in the world.

My work aims to turn analysis into usable structure for decision-makers in industry and the public sector.

**Current interests:** U.S. defense innovation, unmanned systems, tariff strategy and supply chains, and the institutional conditions that turn talent into long-term capacity.
